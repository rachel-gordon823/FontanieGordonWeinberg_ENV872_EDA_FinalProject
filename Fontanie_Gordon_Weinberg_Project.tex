\begin{quote}
Similiar to our first research question, we conducted a visual analysis
of PM2.5 and PM10 levels within Dnipro and Lviv for years 2021 and 2022.
For each of our visualizations, we created line plots that showed the
air pollution levels within the city, comparing 2021 to 2022. As we
needed to visualize the levels of both PM2.5 and PM10, we created four
different plots - ``PM2.5 Levels in Dnipro'', ``PM2.5 Levels in Lviv'',
``PM10 Levels in Dnipro'', and ``PM10 Levels in Lviv''. Within each of
these plots, we also created annotations to indicate the specific dates
of the missile attacks within the cities to see if there were any PM2.5
or PM10 increases or decreases around those dates. Additionally, we
conducted a linear regression analysis for each of these charts to
understand if there is a significant difference in PM2.5 levels and PM10
levels within Dnipro and Lviv in March of 2021 compared to March of
2022.\\

\begin{quote}
\textbf{PM2.5 in Dnipro}\\
When plotting PM2.5 levels in Dnipro in 2021 compared to 2022, it is
evident that overall, PM2.5 levels were higher in 2021 than 2022. It is
also interesting to note that around March 11 in 2022, when the missile
attack occured, there appears to be an uptick in PM2.5 levels and then
sharply decreases shortly after. Overall in both years, there seems to
be a variety of fluctuation in PM2.5 levels and they are not consistent
within each year. Additionally, within most of 2022, PM2.5 levels stayed
within ``good'' to ``moderate'' levels, with an exception of reaching a
level of ``unhealthy for sensitive groups'' at the end of March 2022. In
March 2021, however, the PM2.5 levels were mainly in the ``unhealthy for
sensitive groups'' or ``unhealthy'' category, with only a few days
throughout that month in ``moderate'' levels.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
For the statistical analysis, we ran a linear regression model of pm2.5
levels by year within Dnipro, to understand if there are significant
differences in PM2.5 levels within the city in March 2021 compared to
March 2022. The linear regression showed the slope was negative
(-32.253), meaning that PM2.5 levels decreased in 2022 compared to 2021.
Additionally, the linear regression showed that the relationship between
PM2.5 levels and year in Dnipro is significant (p = 5.074e-10), meaning
that there is a significant difference in PM2.5 levels in Dnipro in 2022
compared to 2021.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{PM2.5 in Lviv}\\
When plotting PM2.5 levels in Lviv in 2021 compared to 2022, there is no
clear difference in levels between years. It is interesting to note that
before the March 18 attack, PM2.5 levels were increasing, and after the
March 18, 2022 missile attack, it appears levels sharply decreased.
Overall in both years, it appears that there seems to be a variety of
fluctuation in PM2.5 in Lviv. Additionally, within both 2021 and 2022,
it is very rare that levels are within the ``good'' range of PM2.5
(\textless15.4) and are typically within ``moderate'' to ``unhealthy''
levels.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
For the statistical analysis, we ran a linear regression model of PM2.5
levels by year within Lviv, to understand if there are significant
differences in levels within the city in March 2021 compared to March
2022. Through the analysis, we found that the slope was negative
(-10.284), meaning that PM2.5 levels decreased in 2022 compared to 2021.
However, the linear regression showed that the negative relationship
between PM2.5 levels and year in Lviv is not significant (p=0.1639).

\textbf{PM10 in Dnipro}\\
When plotting PM10 levels in Dnipro in 2021 compared to 2022, it is
evident that overall, PM10 levels were higher in 2021 compared to 2022.
When looking at the PM10 levels around the March 11 attack in 2022,
there does not appear to be a significant increase. Additionally, in
March 2022, PM10 levels seemed to stay within or below ``moderate''
levels, whereas 2021 levels ranged from ``moderate'' to ``unhealthy for
sensitive groups''.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
For the statistical analysis, we ran a linear regression of PM10 levels
by year within Dnipro, to understand if there are significant
differences in levels within the city in March 2021 compared to March
2022. Through the analysis, we found that the slope was negative
(-15.677), meaning that PM10 levels decreased in 2022 compared to 2021.
Additionally, the linear regression showed that these results are
statistically significant (p=4.325e-07), meaning there is a significant
difference in PM10 levels in Dnipro in 2022 compared to 2021.

\textbf{PM10 in Lviv}\\
When plotting PM10 levels in Lviv in 2021 compared to 2022, there is no
clear difference observed in PM10 levels between the years. It is also
interesting to note that there does not seem to a significant change in
PM10 levels after the March 18 attack, and PM10 levels appear to sharply
drop after the March 26 attack. Additionally, PM10 levels in both years
stay mainly within ``unhealthy for sensitive groups'' to ``good''
levels, but at some points in 2021, levels reach into the ``unhealthy''
level.

that PM10 levels decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 in Lviv. However,
the linear regression showed that these results are not statistically
significant (p=0.1364), meaning that there is not a significant
difference in PM10 levels in Lviv in 2022 compared to 2021.
